# lift-off-project
spring  2018  lift-off assignment

Overview
I want to create a web application that allows someone to create an account that allows them to upload and download several types of files to Amazon Web Services. In addition have several classes of accounts with varying privileges . An Administrator class that can provide oversight to the other levels ie. (change privileges, delete users, and review uploads). An editor class that can upload, download files, as well as modify others files. Finally a Filer class that can only view and download files. I believe that this will be a useful application for allowing greater control of a workplaceâ€™s output while still allowing the convenience of the cloud. I am especially interested in trying to including include specialized data types such as geo-tagged photos, forms that have a signature feature, and summary of action for an account. I wish to do this project because it aligns with several possible job opportunities I wish to pursue.

Features
CRUD for both users and files oversight of privileges logging function of activities geotagged photos form submission/signature

Technologies
JavaScript
HTML/CSS
AWS S3 
Cloud 9 
React
node JS

What I'll Have to Learn
Cloud 9 is an IDE recently acquired by Amazon for use with AWS i want to be able to use this and REACT to provide the necessary functionality. Google Maps API or Open Street Maps to provide the necessary GIS functions I am still figuring out which technology to use for the form signature aspects
